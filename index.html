<p>I am a PhD student in Mathematics at the Courant Institute, New York University. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/">Prof. Mehryar Mohri</a> and work closely with <a href="https://research.google/people/author121/">Corinna Cortes</a>. I have also had the opportunity to collaborate with, or be mentored by, several research scientists at Google Research during my internships, including  <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MDfW21AAAAAJ&hl=en/">Pranjal Awasthi</a>, <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/rbassily">Raef Bassily</a>, <a href="https://cdann.net/">Christoph Dann</a>, <a href="https://xavigonzalvo.github.io/">Javier Gonzalvo</a>, <a href="https://www.satyenkale.com/">Satyen Kale</a>,  <a href="https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~tmarino2/">Teodor Marinov</a>, <a href="https://research.google/people/DmitryStorcheus/">Dmitry Storcheus</a>,  <a href="http://theertha.info/">Ananda Theertha Suresh</a>, <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=isgoo2QAAAAJ&hl=en">Julian Zimmert</a>, etc.
<br>

<p>My main area of research is learning theory, and in particular in the last few years, I have worked on the following topics: consistency theory and guarantees, adversarial robustness, active learning, learning with abstentions, ranking, etc. While I am interested in theory, I am also strongly interested in designing algorithms with good theoretical guarantees.

<p>I have also been fortunate to spend a fair amount of time as a research intern/student researcher at Google Research. This experience has given me the opportunity to work on large-scale problems for which I have derived enhanced and improved algorithmic solutions that I have fully implemented and experimented with. My goal is to use theoretical insights to develop principled and practical algorithms that can handle real-world problems.
